            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>HVmility is a great dignity, even above other vertues; that whereas they frame the minde plyable to the rule of God in ſome ſubject, humility ſubmits it in all things to Gods ordination and government. As it is the evill of Pride above other ſinnes, that the inordination which makes other ſinnes to be ſinnes, is in a manner ſpecificall and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to pride, as Pride (<hi>Syr.</hi> 10.12) <hi>The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Pride is when one departs from God, and his heart is turned from his maker.</hi> Therefore it hath for its propriety, that which conſtitutes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of ſinne, averſation from God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to the creature; and for that reaſon is rightly called the beginning of ſinne.

                     <p>Finally Beloved, no Chriſtian muſt entertain thoughts of travailing to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> any other way then CHRIST went, and it is written that our Lord went to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (that ſignifies, the ſight of Peace) by <hi>Bethany,</hi> which ſignifies, the houſe of griefe.

                     <p>St. PAUL would have us looke unto IESUS the authour of our Faith, and if we looke upon him, ſhall we not ſee him a man of ſorrowes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as it were of ſole griefe, who having no ſinnes of his owne to ſorrow for, lamented the ſinnes of all the world, aſſuming on his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoule a ſorrow equivalent to them all: and

                     <p>IN Spirituall matters the worke of Meekneſſe is, at the pleaſure of God to take alike the with-drawing of inner ſweetneſſe, and the over-flowing of the cup in ſenſible devotion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently to endure the moleſtation of the Old man and preſence of evill, the imperfection of the New man and abſence of good.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:17531:56"/>
                     <p>Concupiſcence is ever inhabiting in us, but it doth not ever equally aſſault us, God in grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it, and curbing the enemy that hee may not ſtirre it, nor tempt ſo much as hee could, diſquieting the Soule with his fiery darts, and violent injections. But when to humble God's ſervants and let them know themſelves, and for other holy ends, Sinne and Sathan are let looſe upon them, with all forces to invade and buffet them (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7) that incumbrance paſſeth all other vexations.</p>
                     <p>PAUL met with infinite miſeries, calamities, oppoſitions, perſecutions, but all of them did not ſo weary him of his life as the incounter of Concupiſcence, in which he bemoan'd his wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe, and ſued to bee ſpeedily delivered from the mortall body, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.24.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is the perfection of Meekneſſe, and manifeſts the power thereof in the greateſt meaſure of reſignation, not to deſpiſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of God ſmiting <hi>Subtractionis verbare,</hi> nor be impatient under his moſt grievous hand, ſcourging with the Rod of the oppreſſour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſtrong temptations.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitation of Sinne is more redious then any priſon or penance, and it is a ſervitute worſe, then <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> worſe then <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian,</hi> to be captive and ſold under ſinne, ſo that it may act in a man whether hee will or not, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and moleſt all his ſenſes and faculties with offenſive motions.</p>
                     <p>For albeit Concupiſcence, as remitted in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17531:57"/> be not reckoned for a ſinne, unleſſe it be conſented to in its inclinations, and therefore the Apoſtle urged much, but not conſenting, ſaid; It is no more I, but ſinne that dwelleth in mee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. Yet becauſe Concupiſcence is in its owne nature evill, the ſtirrings of it are more then any thing elſe ingrate and irkeſome to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding in the bitter conflicts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and ſtrivings of the Fleſh and the Spirit, the Meeke ſaith not (with <hi>Rebecca</hi>) why is it thus with mee? But rather ſayth, it is the Lord, and I will beare the Indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him, untill hee pleades my cauſe, and judge the Enemy (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9) it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces me that his grace is ſufficient for mee, that, though I bee burthen'd, I doe not fayle, though I be hard driven, I doe not yeeld, but reſiſt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Grace deteſt and abandon Sinne more then Hell, more then the Devill, and ever ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly labours and ſolicites for complete purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from all the reliques and fomes of it, yet attends it therein Gods leiſure, contented to ſerve him in hard battels, with luſts warring in the fleſh, till hee ſhall thinke fit to releaſe. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the heate of contention with Sinne, praying for deliverance meekely thankes God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25) as glad hee could ſtand in ſo cruell aſſaults, and willing to continue the fight ſo long as God ſhould judge it meete to hold him in warres, which is a worke of perfect Meekneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover the Meeke is not male-content,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17531:57"/> though in Spirituall things his abilitie of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance be not anſwerable to his will,<note place="margin">Dacxian in ſpeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Monachorum. pag. <hi>386. 387.</hi>

                     <p>Now the inheritance of this Meekneſſe is to repoſe the ſoule that complies with God in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall peace and tranquillitie, that it may rejoyce and be quiet evermore, and in every thing, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced againſt all tempeſts, releeved in all mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: According to that Proverbe, <hi>Manſuetus homo cordis eſt medicus,</hi> now hee were an ill Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian if hee could not cure himſelfe, an ill Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian of the heart, if hee could not cure his owne impaſſion'd heart with the preſcripts of reaſon and receits of grace.</p>
                     <p>Wee may take knowledge that the graces of the Spirit, that ſeeme repugnant, feare, joy, hope, griefe, — have their mutuall intercourſe as from the ſame Spirit, whoſe operations bee divers, but not contrary, and as ſpontaneous and moved by faith they be coaſſiſtant, and worke according to occaſions from God, without any impediment one to the other. And Meekneſſe therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the acting of any Chriſtian vertues, but the miſcarriage of the Fleſh in them, which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17531:58"/> faine would that its melancholike and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd paſſions,<note place="margin">Inter lachrymas &amp; ſuſpiria.</note> turbulent reſiſtance of evill and inordinate appetite of good might goe for grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thereupon in the ranke of the Eight happie men, the Meeke is ſeated betweene the teares of the bleſſed Mourner and the fighes of bleſſed hunger, Meekneſſe is in the middle betweene bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter griefe and burning deſire, becauſe it is not the lenity of the Spirit but the ſtupidity of the fleſh, which ſorrow according to God doth not goe before, and deſire in the Lord follow.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Meeke lament Sinne, as who are with ſorrow to fight againſt it, and waſte and waſh away the remainders of it with their teares, but ſo, that repenting they pacifie themſelves in CHRIST, and be not tormented greatly with the remembrance of paſt and pardon'd ſinnes, but humbled onely and provoked to more abundant care and diligence (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9.10) They mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply alſo vehement deſires but not impatient, deſire ever freedome from Concupiſcence, deſire all perfection (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8) but content thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires perpetually with Gods preſent aſſiſtance and diſpenſation.</p>

This is life Eternall to know God, and rightly is it termed <hi>Eternall,</hi> becauſe it alters not, becauſe by reaſon of their ſeeing God their thoughts vary not. And for that, God is all in all unto the bleſſed, all their joy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe is alwayes the ſame and vnchangeably before them altogether. For in the <hi>Beatitude</hi> flowing from the divine viſion there is no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as there is no change in the divine Nature, that which hath beene is, that which is that is the very ſame which ſhall bee, this is peculiar to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity that it is altogether at once, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it firſt or laſt. Which proprietie the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Saints participates, for that the joy thereof is without all Succeſſion, and is injoyed all at once
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17531:133"/> admitting nor dimunition nor increaſe for ever. So as the joy that is received throughout all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, is perceived in every moment thereof; and the elect Angels and men ſecure of everlaſting felicitie, and having before their eyes Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie repleniſhed with joy, in every inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce an eternall conſolation.</p>

                     <p>I Have made a ſurvey of this <hi>Beatitude</hi> in the parts, and will now gather from the whole theſe foure deductions. Firſt, that the chiefe happineſſe under Heaven is to be reviled and perſecuted for righteouſneſſe and CHRIST'S ſake. Secondly, that the perſecuted therefore muſt not hate but love and pray for their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. Thirdly, that the Apoſtles and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, are of all moſt incident to be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Fourthly, yet they and others according to their place, muſt not neglect righteouſneſſe and propagating CHRISTS name.</p>
